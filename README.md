## Tutorial: Polynomial Derivatives
1. Type the equation.
> Equation must be a polynomial.
2. Equation Writting Rules.
> + The format for kx^a is **kxa**
> + Variable have to be **x**.
> + For example: 2x^3 -> **2x3**
> + x^4 + 3x^2 + 2x^1 -> **x4+3x2+2x1**
> + If you want to use negative, place it after + sign.
> + Example: x^2 - 2x^5 -> **x2+-2x5**
> + Don't use any space.
> + Don't use non integers power.
> + Example Power: 1,2,3,4,...,9999
